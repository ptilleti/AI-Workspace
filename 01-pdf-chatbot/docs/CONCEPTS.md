# 🧠 AI Concepts Explained Simply

A beginner-friendly guide to understanding AI/LLM concepts.

## Core Concepts

### 1. What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?

**Simple explanation**: A very large AI trained to predict the next word.

**How it works**:
- Trained on massive amounts of text from the internet
- Learns patterns in language
- Given some text, it predicts what comes next
- Keep predicting → you get a full response

**Examples**: GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Gemini

### 2. Tokens

**What**: The "words" that LLMs understand (but not exactly words!)

**Rule of thumb**:
- 1 token ≈ 4 characters
- 1 token ≈ 0.75 words
- "Hello world" = 2 tokens
- "AI chatbot" = 3 tokens

**Why it matters**:
- LLMs have token limits (context window)
- API costs are per token
- GPT-4o-mini: 128K token context window

### 3. Context Window

**What**: Maximum amount of text an LLM can process at once

**Think of it as**: The LLM's "short-term memory"

**Examples**:
- GPT-4o-mini: 128,000 tokens (~96,000 words)
- Claude: 200,000 tokens
- Llama 3: 8,000-128,000 tokens

**For our chatbot**:
- If PDF + question < context window → CAG works great
- If too large → need RAG (see below)

### 4. Temperature

**What**: Controls randomness/creativity of responses

**Scale**: 0.0 to 1.0 (sometimes higher)

**Examples**:
- **0.0**: Deterministic, same answer every time (good for factual questions)
- **0.5**: Balanced
- **1.0**: Creative, varied responses (good for creative writing)

**Try it**: Ask the same question with different temperatures!

### 5. Prompt Engineering

**What**: The art of writing good instructions for LLMs

**Components**:
- **System Prompt**: How should the AI behave? (e.g., "You are a helpful teacher")
- **User Prompt**: Your actual question
- **Context**: Additional information (like PDF content)

**Example**:
```
System: "You are a code expert. Explain concepts simply."
User: "What is a variable?"
```

**Tips**:
- Be specific
- Give examples
- Set the tone/style
- Provide context

### 6. CAG vs RAG

#### CAG (Context Augmented Generation)
**What**: Send entire document as context

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement
- Works great for small-medium documents
- No extra infrastructure

**Cons**:
- Limited by context window
- More expensive (more tokens)

**Best for**: Single book, article, manual

#### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
**What**: Search for relevant chunks, send only those

**How it works**:
1. Split document into chunks
2. Convert chunks to embeddings (vectors)
3. Store in vector database
4. When user asks question:
   - Convert question to embedding
   - Find similar chunks
   - Send only relevant chunks to LLM

**Pros**:
- Works with huge documents
- More cost-effective
- Can handle multiple documents

**Cons**:
- More complex
- Requires vector database
- Can miss context

**Best for**: Large knowledge bases, multiple documents

### 7. Embeddings

**What**: Converting text into numbers (vectors) that capture meaning

**Example**:
- "dog" → [0.2, 0.8, 0.1, ...]
- "puppy" → [0.19, 0.81, 0.09, ...]
- "cat" → [0.25, 0.75, 0.15, ...]

**Why**: Similar meanings = similar vectors

**Use**: Find related content in RAG

**Models**: 
- OpenAI: text-embedding-3-small
- Open source: sentence-transformers

### 8. Vector Database

**What**: Database optimized for similarity search

**Purpose**: Store embeddings and find similar ones quickly

**Examples**:
- ChromaDB (simple, good for learning)
- Pinecone (managed service)
- Weaviate (open source)
- FAISS (Facebook's library)

**In RAG**: Stores document chunks as vectors

### 9. AI Agents

**What**: AI that can use tools and take actions

**Beyond chatbots**: Can actually DO things

**Components**:
1. **LLM**: The "brain"
2. **Tools**: Functions it can call (search, calculator, APIs, etc.)
3. **Memory**: Remember past conversations
4. **Planning**: Break down complex tasks

**Example workflow**:
```
User: "What's the weather in NYC and Paris?"
Agent thinks: "I need weather data"
Agent uses: Weather API tool
Agent synthesizes: Response with both cities
```

**Frameworks**: LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI

### 10. Function Calling / Tool Use

**What**: LLM decides which function to call based on user input

**How**:
1. Define available functions to LLM
2. User asks question
3. LLM decides: "I need to call the weather function"
4. Your code executes the function
5. Result goes back to LLM
6. LLM formulates final answer

**Example**:
```python
tools = [
    {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get weather for a city",
        "parameters": {"city": "string"}
    }
]
```

## Common Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Fine-tuning** | Training an LLM further on your specific data |
| **Zero-shot** | LLM performs task without examples |
| **Few-shot** | Give LLM a few examples before your question |
| **Hallucination** | When LLM makes up false information |
| **Inference** | Running the model to get a response |
| **Pre-training** | Initial training on massive datasets |
| **Quantization** | Compressing model to use less memory |
| **RLHF** | Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback |
